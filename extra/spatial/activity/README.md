That means, you are not allowed to change the data by any means. Exceptions from this License can be permitted by the author [Mirko MÃ¤licke](mailto:mirko@hydrocode.de). 
Despite the license you **are** allowed to use and change the data in the context of the Data management lecture at Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg. 

I will grant permission to use the files in most cases, but as the data files contain some very personalizable informations, the default license is quite plimited.

This does not affect the other folders in this repository.
